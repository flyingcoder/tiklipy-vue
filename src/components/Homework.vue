                <p>
                    Write a short story that showcases your creativity and imagination. Your story should have a clear beginning,
                    middle, and end. Consider the following elements while writing your story:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4">
                    <li>Setting: Choose a unique and interesting setting for your story...</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Characters: Develop well-rounded characters with distinct personalities, motivations, and emotions. Include a protagonist and at least one other significant character.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Conflict: Introduce a conflict or problem that the protagonist faces. This conflict could be internal
                        (emotional or moral) or external (a physical challenge or an antagonist).
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Plot: Create a compelling plotline that engages the reader. Build suspense and tension as the story
                        progresses.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Resolution: Provide a satisfying resolution to the conflict. Your ending can be happy, sad, or open-ended, but
                        it should leave a lasting impact on the reader.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Language and Style: Use descriptive language, varied sentence structures, and literary devices (such as
                        similes, metaphors, and personification) to enhance your story's richness and depth.
                    </li>
                </ul>
