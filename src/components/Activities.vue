        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Activity 1: Ecosystem Scavenger Hunt</h2>
        <p class="text-base mb-4">Organize a scavenger hunt in the schoolyard or a local park. Students work in teams to find and document various components of an ecosystem, such as plants, insects, rocks, and signs of animal activity. This activity promotes observation skills and introduces students to the concept of ecosystems.</p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Activity 2: Species Spotlight</h2>
        <p class="text-base mb-4">Assign each student a different local species to research. They create a one-page "Species Spotlight" with information about the species' habitat, diet, behavior, and significance within the ecosystem. Students can present their spotlights to the class, enhancing research and presentation skills.</p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Activity 3: Green Solutions Design</h2>
        <p class="text-base mb-4">Challenge students to brainstorm and design innovative solutions for environmental challenges in their assigned ecosystems. They can create prototypes, diagrams, or presentations showcasing their ideas. This activity encourages creative problem-solving and critical thinking.</p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Activity 4: Nature Journaling</h2>
        <p class="text-base mb-4">Students maintain nature journals throughout the project. They record observations, sketches, and reflections during outdoor explorations. This activity fosters a deeper connection with nature and helps students understand the interconnectedness of living organisms within ecosystems.</p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Activity 5: Habitat Diorama</h2>
        <p class="text-base mb-4">In small groups, students create habitat dioramas representing their assigned ecosystems. They include key elements such as plants, animals, and physical features. This hands-on activity reinforces understanding of ecosystems' components and interactions.</p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Activity 6: Eco-Friendly Campaign</h2>
        <p class="text-base mb-4">Each group develops an eco-friendly campaign to raise awareness about an environmental challenge. They create posters, infographics, or short videos to educate others and propose actions for positive change. This activity encourages communication skills and advocacy.</p>
